  <p>This project was made to visualize the census information of the united states. Each year the government puts up very detailed information about the population of USA. However it can be very confusing, boring and hard to read. Hence in my project, I aimed to make an interactive system that allows the user to play with the data and understand it better.</p>

  <p>Here I have provided two major categories of the census: Population and Poverty. The circles on the maps show how large the population/poverty is in a particular county.</p>

  <p>When you hover over a chosen county, it shows the name of the county, the state, its population/poverty count and a simple bar graph that shows the division of male and female populations.</p>

  <p>When you click on the county, you can see information about the countyâ€™s population on the right. Right now I have picked the ethnicity distribution and the age distribution.</p>

  <p>I have chosen the map so that it would be easier to visualize the counties by place rather than have them on a list or a graph where we would have to manually look for them. I thought it was more natural to look for a place on a map.</p>

  <p>I have chosen a bar graph to represent the male and female population since it was the simplest way for the eye to compare and contrast two items side by side. Since it was a hover card, I wanted something easy to look at.</p>

  <p>On the right I put more information in the form a pie graph so that it would give a more detailed vie wolf the distribution. Since the user would  have clicked( which is more effort that hovering), it means that he is more interested to look at the details.</p>

  <p>I was trying to filter the map so you can select each state for further detail and ease. However I was not able to do that. I would like to know how to implement it in the future!</p>
